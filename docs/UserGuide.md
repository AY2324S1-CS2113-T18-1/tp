## Starting a game

Upon launching the application, ChessMaster checks if there is a previous game in progress. If a previous game exists, you'll be presented with the option to continue from where you left off. Please enter `y` for **yes** and `n` for **no**.

```
You have an ongoing previous chess game. Continue game? [y/n]
```

However, if you prefer to **start a fresh game** or if **no previous game is found**, ChessMaster will prompt you to select your preferred colorâ€”whether it's "White" or "Black." Please enter `b` for **black** and `w` for **white**.

```
Choose your starting color to start new game! [b/w]
```

Next, you can choose the difficulty of the AI you will be pitched against! The current supported difficulty levels range from 1 to 4. Please enter the number corresponding to your preferred difficulty level.
```
Choose your difficulty level! [1/2/3/4]

```

Now, you'll be off to a rewarding journey of enhancing your chess skills and enjoying the timeless game of strategy and tactics with ChessMaster!

## Gameplay

The gameplay system of ChessMaster provides you with the flexibility to enter either a **command** or a **move** during your turn. 

- If you opt for a **command**, the system will promptly solicit your next action, allowing you to access various [features](#features) seamlessly. However, when you decide to make a move, the system will evaluate your input for validity. 
- Only when you enter a **valid move** will your turn be passed to the CPU, enabling it to respond with its strategic move. 

Additionally, every time a move is executed, ChessMaster provides a comprehensive view of the chessboard, displaying the state of the game following the previous move.

## Ending the game

The game will automatically end and a victor be declared when one side has been checkmated (i.e. their king is in check, 
and there is no possible escape), or if their king has been captured.

## Features

To make a move, simply enter the coordinate of the piece to be moved, followed by the coordinates it is to be moved to.

Format: `[column][row] [column][row]`

Examples: 
- `a2 a4`
- `b3 g6`

ChessMaster also automatically checks if the move was valid and legal before it is executed, and shows the following error
message in the case of an invalid move:

`Oops, that move isn't valid!`


### Show available moves: `moves`
