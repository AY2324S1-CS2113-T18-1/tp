## Starting a game

Upon launching the application, ChessMaster checks if there is a previous game in progress. If a previous game exists, you'll be presented with the option to continue from where you left off. Please enter `y` for **yes** and `n` for **no**.

```
You have an ongoing previous chess game. Continue game? [y/n]
```

However, if you prefer to **start a fresh game** or if **no previous game is found**, ChessMaster will prompt you to select your preferred colorâ€”whether it's "White" or "Black." Please enter `b` for **black** and `w` for **white**.

```
Choose your starting color to start new game! [b/w]
```

Now, you'll be off to a rewarding journey of enhancing your chess skills and enjoying the timeless game of strategy and tactics with ChessMaster!

## Gameplay

The gameplay system of ChessMaster provides you with the flexibility to enter either a **command** or a **move** during your turn. 

- If you opt for a **command**, the system will promptly solicit your next action, allowing you to access various [features](#features) seamlessly. However, when you decide to make a move, the system will evaluate your input for validity. 
- Only when you enter a **valid move** will your turn be passed to the CPU, enabling it to respond with its strategic move. 

Additionally, every time a move is executed, ChessMaster provides a comprehensive view of the chessboard, displaying the state of the game following the previous move.
